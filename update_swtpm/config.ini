#   Ordering of downloading and compiling is different due to
# networking consideration, following option switches is mostly
# the order required to install due to dependency issue.

#   After the entire installation process finishes, you can
# partially re-compiling as well
#
# Known issue:
#   1. re-compiling `install_swtpm` requires `install_pkgconfig`
# enabled, or else it would complains about syntax error about
# `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` pkg-config installed macro
